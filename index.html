    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.</p>
<p>Sprinkle the inside cavity of each game hen with salt and pepper. Insert one slice of prosciutto, two sprigs of rosemary and one crushed whole clove of garlic inside each bird. Truss the birds with string and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Pour the melted butter into a metal baking dish and turn the trussed birds in it to coat well. Arrange the birds on their backs and scatter the giblets around them. Place the baking dish on the stove and bring the butter to the sizzling point.</p>
<p>Place the dish in the oven and bake 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Turn the hens on their sides and bake 15 minutes longer, basting occasionally.</p>
<p>Turn the hens to the opposite side and continue baking, basting occasionally, about 10 minutes longer.</p>
<p>Arrange the hens on their backs and bake 5 minutes longer, basting often.</p>
<p>Remove the birds to a serving dish. Pour most of the fat from the pan. Add the chicken broth, place the pan on the stove and stir to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom of the pan. Untruss the birds. Pour the sauce over the birds and serve them hot or cold.</p>

<p>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, and cider vinegar in a bowl; mix well.
</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf pans with cooking spray or line with aluminum foil for easier cleanup (see Cook's Note).</p>
<p>Place onion and green pepper in covered microwave container and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.</p>
<p>In large mixing bowl, combine garlic, eggs, thyme, seasoned salt, black pepper, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, milk, and oats. Mix well. Stir in cooked onion and green pepper. Add ground beef, pork, and veal. With gloved hands, work all ingredients together until completely mixed and uniform.</p>
<p>Divide meatloaf mixture in half and pat half of mixture into each prepared loaf pan. Brush loaves with half of the glaze; set remainder of glaze aside.</p>
<p>Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes. Remove pans from oven; carefully drain fat. Brush loaves with remaining glaze. Return to oven and bake for 10 minutes more. Remove pans from oven and allow meatloaf to stand for 15 minutes before slicing.</p>

<h3 id="sushi" class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
<p>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, mirin and soy sauce. Heat oil in an 8" square metal non-stick baking pan on medium heat, by placing pan directly on stove element. Use heat-proof tongs to hold the pan.</p>

<p>Pour half the egg mixture into a pan. Allow edges of egg mixture to set, then, using a spatula, fold egg from top third and bottom third of omelette into the middle of the pan. You will end up with three layers of omelette in the middle of the pan. Use a spatula to press gently on omelette to compress layers.</p>
<p>Pour in remainder of egg mixture and repeat process. You should end up with a little layered "loaf" of omelette in the centre of the pan. Remove from heat.</p>

<p>Transfer omelette to chopping board. Allow to cool 5 minutes. Trim uneven edges off and slice omelette into about 30 neat, thin slices.</p>
